# auto-fare-predicto
A simple Cab Fare Prediction web application built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and a responsive frontend. The system calculates ride fares based on distance and vehicle type. It includes user login functionality and dynamic fare calculation, making it a basic full-stack cab booking prototype for learning and experimentation.
